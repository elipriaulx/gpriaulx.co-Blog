		<content>&lt;p&gt;After seeing Wyam in action over at ReactiveUi, it seemed like a natural progression for my otherwise neglected Wordpress blog. I consider Wordpess both a wonderfull and terrible product, and my implementation offered little to reinforce the former sentiment. Maybe Wordpress isn't really practical for technical content; maybe I am just awkward and difficult, with unrealistic expectations; maybe my hosting environment and blog management is poor; or maybe an awkward intersection of the lot.&lt;/p&gt;
